## Multilayer Perceptron
The best-known feedforward neural network





Linearr Separability
in a 2D plot of a classifier with 2 categories, it's possible to divide the categories with a straight line.

Which of the following is NOT true about the "fully-connected" feature of a multilayer perceptron?
You are correct!
All neurons in the input layer have the same number of inputs as the neural network (plus a bias input)



"fully-connected" feature of a multilayer perceptron?
- Every neuron has as many inputs as neurons in the previous layer (plus a bias input).
- All inputs are fed to all neurons in the first hidden layer.
- The output of every neuron is fed to every neuron in the next layer.
